## About
This Repo is designed to serve a gap in the market. The 2008 Silicon Knights Xbox 360 game - Too Human - has been a pretty big community talking point since it's release. However when it came to underground content, there was very little produced. The main reason for this? The gamesaves contained a custom-built hash to validate them meaning, as far as i could find, only 1 working save editor has ever been seen.

## Compaitibility
This project has been built using C# in Visual Studio. The GUI is WPF based, the framework is .NET 4.5.

## Community
I'm not expecting a large amount of interest in this Repo, mainly due to the age of the game, the fact it can no longer be downloaded and the mixed reviews it received when it was release. I am however, very happy to be contacted, take suggestions or see your own contributions.

If you like it, let me know!
